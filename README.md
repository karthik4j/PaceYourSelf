# About 
PaceYourSelf is a todo-list application that is different from a conventional todo-list. It encourages the user to break down their work into manageable parts. It divides tasks into two categories, Important and Miscellaneous. At a time, users can only add 3 important tasks, which helps them prioritize important tasks and manage time. If some tasks is not that important, it can be added to the Miscellaneous section. 
Under this section, users may add as many tasks as they want.  

# How to use 
The PaceYourSelf app was designed to be intuitive to use, but some users may still have doubts about how to use the app. In that case, this tutorial serves to help them.
                  <p></p>
                  The tasks in this app are categorized into two, "Important" and "Miscellaneous".
                  Users can only add three important task at a time. Users can add additional important tasks only after they complete all three of them. When all three tasks are completed, the app will automatically remove them and the user can add new tasks.
                  <p></p>
                  Miscellaneous tasks are those which the user wish to complete if possible, but it's not that important if they don't. Users can use this section to note down any thoughts that comes to their mind while performing one of the important tasks. Users can add as many miscellaneous tasks as they want.
                  A "Clear tasks" button is provided so that users can clear completed tasks. The app does not remove miscellaneous tasks automatically, providing more granular control to the user.
                  <p></p>
                  The user can add tasks to any of the section by clicking the "Add a new task" button.
                  A window will pop-up so that the user can enter the name of the task. Users may use the enter key to add the task or they can click a button labelled "Let's go" to do the same.
                  <p></p>
                  After completing a task, the user can mark it as completed by clicking the task name, which would change its color to a light green color to indicate that it has been marked. Users can unmark a task by clicking its name.
                  <p></p>
                  The progress bar is used to visually represent the user's progress. 
                  It takes into account both Important and Miscellaneous task completion status.
                  On completing any of these tasks, the progress bar is automatically updated.
                  <p></p>
                  The "Reset everything" button has been provided to remove all tasks from the app. On clicking this button it removes every tasks (whether complete or not) from the screen and also deletes it from the local storage. Only use this feature when you are sure that you know what you are doing.
